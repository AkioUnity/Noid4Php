what:      3721 random identifiers of form b.rllk
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind 
       and mint 3,721 identifiers with the template "b.rllk".
       Sample identifiers would be "99999/b2qr" and "99999/b3H4".
       Minting order is random.

where:     localhost.localdomain:/work/Noid/Noid4Php-mordernized/datafiles
Version:   Noid 1.1.1-0.424-php
Size:      3721
Template:  b.rllk
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_b3".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:GRANIT-)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRANITE")
         "GRANIT-", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
