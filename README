Noid version 0.041
==================

The noid script creates minters (identifier generators) and accepts
commands that operate them.  A minter efficiently generates, tracks,
and binds unique identifiers, which are produced without replacement
in random or sequential order, and with or without a check character
that can be used for detecting transcription errors.  A minter can
bind identifiers to arbitrary element names and element values that
are either stored or produced upon retrieval from rule-based
transformations of requested identifiers; the latter has application
in identifier resolution.

Identifiers generated by these minters are also known as "noids"
(nice opaque identifiers).  Noid minters are suitable for the production
and management of identifiers ranging from persistent, globally unique
names -- ARKs, PURLs, URNs, Handles, LSIDs, etc. -- to short-lived,
compact session keys (cf. UUIDs).  Noid minters are very fast, scalable,
easy to create and tear down, and have a relatively small footprint.
They use BerkeleyDB as the underlying database.
