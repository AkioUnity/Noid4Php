NOID OVERVIEW

The noid utility creates minters (identifier generators) and accepts
commands that operate them.  Once created, a minter can be used to produce
persistent, globally unique names for documents, databases, images,
vocabulary terms, etc.  Properly managed, these identifiers can be used as
long term durable information object references within naming schemes such
as ARK, PURL, URN, DOI, and LSID.  At the same time, alternative minters
can be set up to produce short-lived names for transaction identifiers,
compact web server session keys (cf. UUIDs), and other ephemera.

In general, a noid minter efficiently generates, tracks, and binds
unique identifiers, which are produced without replacement in random or
sequential order, and with or without a check character that can be used
for detecting transcription errors.  A minter can bind identifiers to
arbitrary element names and element values that are either stored or
produced upon retrieval from rule-based transformations of requested
identifiers; the latter has application in identifier resolution.  Noid
minters are very fast, scalable, easy to create and tear down, and have a
relatively small footprint.  They use BerkeleyDB as the underlying database.

Identifiers generated by a noid minter are also known as "noids" (nice
opaque identifiers).  While a minter can record and bind any identifiers 
that you bring to its attention, often it is used to generate, bringing
to your attention, identifier strings that carry no widely recognizable
meaning.  This semantic opaqueness reduces their vulnerability to era-
and language-specific change, and helps persistence by making for
identifiers that can age and travel well.


INSTALLATION

If not already unpacked, unpack the Noid suite with

   tar xzf Noid-0.421.tar.gz

after adjusting the version number as needed.  Version 0.421 is known to
pass build tests on Linux (SuSE 9.0, RH 9, RH 7), SunOS 5.8, Mac OS X,
and NetBSD 1.6.2.

To install the module and script, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

For the "make install" you may have to become the superuser (e.g., with sudo).


DEPENDENCIES
